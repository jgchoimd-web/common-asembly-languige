# Self-Hosting Plan

The self-hosting compiler will be written in the language it compiles.

Bootstrapping stages:

1. Python compiler: fast reference implementation.
2. C compiler: dependency-free AOT compiler.
3. Self-host compiler source: `compiler.cal`.
4. Bootstrap: C compiler compiles the self-host compiler runtime pieces.
5. Self-host: the generated compiler compiles future versions of itself.

Current status: `compiler.cal` is a concrete source sketch for the self-hosted compiler.
The language is intentionally small at first: functions, variables, strings, arrays, `if`,
`while`, and calls into a tiny runtime.
